## Guessing Game vers.1

This is a simple guessing game that you will code all on your own.

Gameplay will be the following:
* Ask for the user's name.
* Ask for a range of numbers the user wants to choose from
	* that way a user can guess a number from 1-3 or 1-10 or 1-2934
	* ninja mode: allow for custom ranges like 23-89 or 2-7
* Ask for the user's guess
* Inform the user if they won or lost, and the number they were trying to guess 


It'll look like this:

>Hello user!  What should I call you? MORTY

>Okay MORTY -- It's time to play the guessing game :-)

>Choose the upper limit of the range: 7

>Okay!  Guess a number from 1-7: 4

>WRONG! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US, MORTY?

>The number was: 5
